His comprehension is great and he is able to draw connections between the text and his own life. He always works hard and loves to participate in class discussions and activities. However, I would encourage SSS to use more complete sentences in his speech. That will increase his language skills. Nonetheless, he is a remarkable student who continuously does outstanding work in all fields. Carry on the hard work, SSS!",
      "SSS is an intelligent and polite student. His pronunciation is good, and his reading as well. He understands the lesson, but learning how to expand beyond the lesson and speak about things he is interested in, is something we will learn together with time. I will continue to encourage him to use complete sentences in his answers and freely share his ideas and opinions.",
      "Hello, dear SSS. I am glad we met again today and had a good English lesson. I want to praise you because you are a hardworking student. You always come to class prepared and learn new words. I would like it if you would use the new vocabulary in a sentence when you give your answer even more. That would really affect your progress and complete understanding of the foreign language you are learning. We will continue to work on improving your skills. Hope to see you next time.",
      "You are such a merry child with a lot of great talents. When it comes to your English skill it is definite that your reading skills provide an advantage, but you are relying on them maybe a little bit too much. It would be much wiser if you would exercise expressing yourself more independently during the conversation. I am not at all worried about your speaking skills. The thing that does worry me is that your responses are often brief, and you would benefit from including more details in your answers. I would like to see and hear you try more complicated sentences and add more details to your answers. To do that you need to carefully reread each lesson, pay attention to details, and use those details more. If there is something that you don't understand, feel free to ask. Keep up the good work!",

I encourage him to share his thoughts with the teacher which is a great practice for improving his conversational skills as well as his critical thinking and self-esteem.

I would like to suggest to him to practice more at home, and if possible, practice the newly learned content by using new words and phrases in sentences.

He has shown a solid understanding of the material we have covered in class. SSS is progressing in reading at a satisfactory rate, but he needs to continue to focus on comprehension.

However, there are many things I see you lack in your knowledge, and this is what makes me think this level is too difficult for you. I believe you would benefit a lot if we return to at least the INSERT LESSON HERE and start from there. Increasing your comprehension skills and vocabulary level is a must for further progress. Extra practice in your spare time will also benefit you a lot.",
      "Dear SSS, it was great to see you in today's class! You showed good participation today, and I appreciate your willingness to cooperate. I would like you to tell me if this lesson was too difficult for you. The lessons are going to be more and more complex, so I doubt that you can keep pace with them bearing in mind your knowledge. Maybe it is better for your progress to go back to some simpler lessons and practice reading together, and not only reading but also speaking and constructing correct and meaningful sentences. Please consider my suggestion and efforts to help you in your way to achieving greater levels of English.",
      "Hello, SSS! You are a very polite student and a good boy. I've noticed that you are trying very hard, but still, I think the chosen material is too difficult for you.

He is always eager to participate by answering comprehension questions in class, which shows he understands the stories we read in class. Although he sometimes struggles with correct verb tenses when speaking, he speaks with much fluency and enthusiasm. His spoken English is good and he is able to present ideas with ease. He is a very strong reader and I am happy with his fluency in speaking. Keep going with your hard work!",
      "Hello, SSS. Thank you for being in this class with me. Unfortunately, you weren't very eager to participate in today's class. I tried my best, but you did everything you could to ignore me. We didn’t even manage to start the lesson because you wouldn’t pay any attention to me and you were yelling/crying most of the class. The only time you calmed down and looked at the screen was when I played the lesson video for you and after the video ended, you wouldn’t answer any of my questions and you went back to ignoring me. I hope that next time you will be in a better mood. Good luck!",
      "SSS is a kind little boy. When he is in a good mood, he works diligently. Sadly, today he wasn't in a very good mood. He got distracted and did the bare minimum. When trying to engage with him, he refuses to say complete sentences, even though he was able to do so a few classes ago. I hope that he will change his behavior, and try his best to learn, study, and enjoy exploring his own potential.",
      "SSS is undoubtedly a very intelligent child, but I'm a little bit concerned about him. He refuses to cooperate and it seems he's less interested to participate and share his opinion lately. If he keeps his focus on the lesson and takes part in classroom discussions, his speaking skills will continue to grow. I encourage SSS to feel free to share his ideas and use complete sentences in his speech. This practice will increase his progress.",
      "SSS is usually a well-behaved and cooperative student, however, in today's class, he has shown a lack of cooperation. I tried as hard as I could to motivate him to speak and repeat after me so that we would learn new words together, but it did not work out. I have been working with the student for some time now, so I do know what he is capable of, but I believe that he did not show that in class; in my opinion, the student understood what I was talking about, but refused to cooperate. Hopefully, we can work better together in the next class!",

SSS is a capable student which he has shown in the past, and I hope he will increase his participation and engage more.",
      "Hello there SSS. It seemed like you struggled a little bit with the answers today. It wasn't easy for you to formulate a sentence with details from the lesson. It'll come with a lot of practice and if you continuously and daily exercise it. Also, the pronunciation could be much better. Try focusing on the sounds your teacher is making when speaking. You'll absorb this pretty fast, I have no doubts about it. You are an intelligent and creative child. Keep working hard!"

Sometimes, SSS is quite playful which can affect his progress. I suggest he works on his focus during classes in order to increase his progress. Nevertheless, SSS can contribute wonderful ideas and intelligent questions to the class. When he speaks, SSS does fairly well. He can express his opinion and answer comprehension questions without much trouble. He is able to make good sentences, and his grammar has improved over time. Keep up the hard work SSS!",
      "SSS is a very intelligent student and usually always comes to a class with a positive attitude, although, lately, he doesn't participate like before. I noticed that his lack of willingness to participate affects his progress (he struggles to remember the details from the story or materials we covered in previous classes). Despite that, his pronunciation and reading comprehension skills are excellent, and he has a good grasp of grammar concepts. Overall, SSS has grown a great deal over the last few months, and I am excited to see him continue to grow and learn.",
      "Thank you for playing with me and for showing me your toys/shoes/etc. They look very nice. I am happy you can tell me a lot about them, but I would also like to study English with you. It would be lovely if we could focus more on the lesson next time. It would make your mom and dad happy too. And if we do our lesson quickly, we can play whatever you want. Thank you for coming to my class, and see you next time. Have a wonderful day!",
      "Hello there SSS! You were incredibly active today, but not very eager to focus on the lesson. Please, in your future classes try to be more observant about the lesson. Also, more speaking practice will fast increase your fluency. Don't forget to practice the use of newly learned words by using them to make sentences. Keep working hard, SSS, and stay curious!",
      "Hello dear SSS. You are a smart child who brings a lot of energy into the classroom. I’ve noticed that sitting still and being fully focused is a big challenge for you, however, nice behavior and paying attention to our materials are highly appreciated and would help you make significant progress. I strongly believe that parental assistance could be of great help.",
      "Hi SSS! Today you were really energetic and, a little unfocused on the lesson, but when you are focused on the lesson then you work flawlessly. Your speaking and pronunciation are improving but there's more work to be done. Surely it will get better with our practice! I encourage you to practice your speaking skills in your spare time, by using newly learned words in making sentences."

      "Hi, dear SSS. I know you started the class in a bad mood. I hope I manage to show you that learning can be fun too. Today we worked on improving your pronunciation. You responded well to all the instructions. Even though you didn't want to have a class, you were great today. Just keep up the good work and playfulness. Hope to see you soon!",

Remember that our main goal is to make you feel comfortable enough so you can absorb the knowledge that is being given to you. This is important, as you are investing in your future success and it will greatly improve your life later down the line. Paying attention, focusing on the rules that I give you, memorizing the keywords, and answering in a full sentence, are all very important skills that you need to work on. Don’t worry, I will guide you every step of your way to success, so you are not alone. With patience, love, and support, I know that you can do it!"

I can see he is paying attention and is already familiar with the lesson material, but he lacks the motivation to talk. Perhaps we can assist him. You are always welcome to propose some of his favorite topics, and I will be happy to ask questions about them. He is a good boy, which is why I am so eager to inspire him!",
      "SSS is such a clever and polite student. However, for some time now, SSS is quite uninterested in our work and barely present. In every class, he is constantly clicking the paint button (even if I turn it off during the whole class), which means that he doesn't listen or talk for the majority of our class. He often gets distracted by other content unrelated to the current lesson. I encourage him to engage more in classroom activities and practice his speaking skills in his spare time. I know he can achieve a lot, and I wish him all the best in his learning journey!",
      "Hello, SSS! I am always happy to see you and hear what you have to say about your day. But today, you weren't very attentive, I had to repeat some of my questions twice or more just to make you speak. I have a feeling that you can do much better than today, and I hope you were just tired. Please, next time, pay more attention to what I ask or show, this can greatly improve and expand your vocabulary. Have a great day, and see you soon!",
      "SSS is a smart child and his pronunciation is always improving. I think he enjoys the stories that we read in class. However, today he was very unfocused and couldn't answer my questions almost at all. I would suggest that he starts reading some English stories at home so he can learn more new words. We will continue practicing his speaking skills in the future. I would also like him to pay more attention to the materials and to what I am saying during the lesson. He has shown himself to be a fast learner, so I expect to see improvement in his English studies. Thank you so much for supporting him! See you soon and have a great day!",
      "SSS has a strong command of English and can speak very well, but I'm afraid he's been very distracted lately, which can slow his progress. SSS's vocabulary is great, just like his pronunciation. He can pronounce newly learned words with great accuracy and excellent intonation. He has a very good understanding, although I encourage him to use complete sentences more often. SSS is a very intelligent child and if he learns to focus more on our lessons, his English skills will grow enormously.",
      "SSS understands the reading materials we covered in class and he has excellent vocabulary skills for his level. I really enjoy hearing what SSS has to say, but unfortunately, SSS's participation level is not where I would like it to be. One thing I would like SSS to work on is his readiness to participate in classroom discussions. If SSS focuses more in class, he will perform even better than he is now.",
      "SSS has a lot of potential and often participated in the past. However, it seems like SSS's progress has been stagnating since I notice a lack of interest on his side to engage more in class discussions. I encourage SSS to feel free to share his ideas and interests in order to gain more speaking practice which will immediately increase his speaking skills.",
      "Hello SSS! I am always happy to see you, but I am not really happy to see that you have a lack of interest in studying English. Today we worked on the main reading and we reviewed the main text. We also reviewed the keywords. Your performance was OK, and not as good as could be. We also worked on additional material, and you solved the assignments successfully. I hope that next time you will be more focused on the lesson than on whatever you are doing when you are in a background mode. You are a smart student, and it is not good if your knowledge is not progressing. I appreciate all your effort today.",
      "SSS is a good child but he doesn't like to speak much in class even though I tried to motivate him. He needs to make more of an effort to stay focused and to complete the class work diligently. SSS needs to stop relying on the teacher to help with his pronunciation and make an effort to read by himself. In listening exercises and activities, he often does well. With a little bit of effort, he understands the teacher and new material well. I hope SSS finds the motivation to do better in the future.",
      "SSS is an intelligent boy with so much potential, but he keeps silent when I let him think about a question. It would be really beneficial for him to practice making full sentences more often. I see that he understands the content, but our goal is to also improve his grammar skills and practice how to make more complex sentences in the future, and that is why making full sentences will help us. I hope he will give his best in the future to cooperate and improve his speaking skills and comprehension.",
      "Hey SSS! It seems you like learning English but have trouble focusing on the material. You are an awesome child and I know that you are studying regularly, but I worry that losing focus will affect your progress. Your pronunciation could use a little more work but it is constantly improving. With a little more effort on your part, I am sure you will improve in future English studies, as you are certainly capable of success. We have done some exercises and you were successful in them. I have faith that all this is going to be really easy for you if you just focus more on the material. Thank you for having this class with me.",
      "SSS is a bright, friendly student who enjoys engaging with the teacher and participating in class. He speaks very well, but he needs to pay more attention to his pronunciation. When he tries hard, his pronunciation improves greatly! I encourage him to freely share his opinion and creativity through active speech, that way he will practice how to make sentences on his own. Also, he reads with good fluency. SSS is usually well prepared for class, and he puts a lot of good effort into his work. His speaking is good, and he always shows enthusiasm to speak in English.

As we continue to improve our grammar skills, let's pay special attention to adding the suffix 's' in the third person singular of the simple present tense. Remember, when using 'he,' 'she,' or 'it,' we add 's' to the verb. For practice, try changing verbs across all pronouns, such as 'I play,' 'You play,' and 'He/She/It plays.' Keep up the excellent work, and I look forward to our next session. Remember to bring your positive attitude with you!",
      "Hi, dear SSS. It is a genuine pleasure to have a diligent student like you. Your active participation and dedication in each class are highly appreciated. Great job!
